# Anti-Codex Handoff For Next Channel

Date: 2026-06-23
Branch: main

## Current State

- Anti-Codex is an isolated desktop/runtime fork using Antigravity Desktop as the default model provider.
- Installed runtime on `http://127.0.0.1:8484` was healthy during the last checks: upstream `antigravity-desktop`, account ready, 8 models.
- Manager is at `native-panel-v84`.
- Standalone real Manager MCP/Skill and plugin/application button gates pass after local feature refresh. The default standalone real-button script now runs only those two non-disruptive actions; report viewing and diagnostics bundle remain opt-in.
- `latest-manager-real-buttons.json` is now indexed by Manager latest reports, diagnostic bundle report summaries, and installed overall report-integrity checks.
- Latest feature parity evidence after refresh: connectors `5866/5866`, app tools `58/58`, missing shared `[]`, callable app tools `0` because no connector is authorized.
- Latest MCP/Skill evidence: MCP `3/3` with `node_repl`, DeepSeek worker, and Antigravity worker visible; expected shared skill union `126`, missing shared `[]`.
- Fast UI smoke, full no-traffic UI smoke, and installed no-traffic overall passed. Short non-fast UI smoke now uses explicit timeout budgets and records `dynamicProbeUnavailable` instead of hanging when the embedded dynamic probe times out.
- Real Antigravity work verifier passed: model `gemini-3.5-flash-low` created a file, executed local `node_repl` MCP, matched the marker, and returned Chinese final text.
- Source preflight fast gate passed before this handoff.

## Next Work

1. Keep stability and identity invariants.
   - No ChatGPT login path in Anti-Codex.
   - No fake connector/app-tool callability.
   - Original Codex remains untouched.
   - Anti-Codex branding and icon must survive host sync.

2. Next useful hardening.
   - Keep Manager button verification serial; do not run Manager/UI verifiers in parallel with installed overall.
   - Prefer short parser/self/contract checks while the user is waiting; reserve full source preflight and installed overall for checkpoint or release acceptance.
   - Re-run runtime sync with translator restart when adaptive-server action inventory changes.

## Completed In This Channel

- Script-level local connector/app-tool verifier exists and passes: `test-anticodex-local-connectors.mjs` proves local endpoint behavior without claiming remote OAuth or real connector authorization.
- Full connector/app-tool cache parity exists and passes in `test-anticodex-plugin-capabilities.ps1`: current evidence is connector parity `5866/5866`, app-tool parity `58/58`, `missingShared:[]`, and callable app tools `0` because no connector is actually authorized.
- Standalone real Manager button gate exists and passes for `mcpSkills` and `pluginCapabilities`, with `lastUiOnly:false` and no fake callable connector/app-tool access.
- Third-party provider history-switch verifier now covers nine turns across provider save, translator restart, OpenAI-compatible provider switch, OpenAI-compatible to Anthropic switch, and Anthropic back to OpenAI-compatible switch.
- Manager latest reports now include MCP/Skill, plugin capabilities, refresh-features, and stability-soak reports; `viewLatestReports` was verified by a real embedded Manager button click.

## Completed On 2026-06-23 Follow-Up

- `e554b40` refreshed `docs/ADAPTIVE_ONE_API_STACK.md` into the current Anti-Codex provider stack: local translator, Antigravity Desktop default, explicit third-party profiles, no ChatGPT login route, no original Codex mutation, and no fake connector authorization.
- `a462ce5` moved the old DeepCodex/DeepSeek video script into `docs/marketing/legacy/deepcodex-video-script.md` and created a current Anti-Codex `docs/marketing/video-script.md`.
- `1ea453d` refreshed `docs/chat-to-responses-compat.md` into the current provider compatibility contract, including OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible structured tool-history preservation. The `deepcodex.reasoning.hex.v1:` prefix remains documented only as an internal compatibility token.
- `9077d81` marked `docs/DEEPSEEK_RUNTIME_FAILURE_NOTES.md` as legacy DeepSeek-route notes so the file is not mistaken for the current default provider path.
- `a546ef3` clarified Windows setup docs: `codex-home-deepseek-app` is legacy compatibility state, and connector-backed app tools stay unavailable until real authorization exists.
- Short verification only was run for this follow-up: focused `rg` contract checks and `git diff --check`. Full source preflight and installed overall remain reserved for the next release-acceptance pass.
- `24b9d17` added launcher contract coverage for current public docs, using a whitelist of README, provider-stack, compatibility, and current marketing entry points instead of recursive historical scans.
- `579f802` refreshed README provider boundaries: Antigravity Desktop default, explicit third-party provider profiles through Manager, no silent wrong-upstream fallback, and no connector-backed app-tool authorization from metadata.
- `9e05b0b` added a fast source-preflight `publicDocumentation` gate so public-doc regressions are caught even when translator regression is skipped.
- `3ee8585` surfaced the fast public-doc gate as `publicDocumentationOk` in translator diagnostics and diagnostic bundle summaries, and corrected README wording to `upstream profile` / Manager as the formal user entry.
- `6041556` made installed overall check `sourcePreflight.publicDocumentationOk` directly through diagnostics, including fast mode where the standalone diagnostics verifier is skipped.
- `b9b3efe` added field-level public-doc status to Manager latest-report payload and summaries for `latest-source-preflight.json`.

## Fresh Lessons For Next Channel

- If plugin capability parity reports `missingShared`, run `refresh-anticodex-local-features.ps1`; do not weaken the no-fake-authorization gate.
- Do not trust stale visible Manager result text. Real button success must match the current `lastAction` and clear pending/queued action state.
- Avoid complex nested PowerShell through `rtk proxy`; use short commands, `curl.exe`, `rg`, or a small script file for probes that need `$null`, `$_`, arrays, or regexes.
- Current docs can mention old compatibility names, but they must say why. Historical DeepCodex/DeepSeek launch material should move under `legacy` or carry a clear legacy marker.

## Worker Note

- Older worker outputs were advisory only. The accepted evidence is the current source tests and installed no-traffic overall listed above.
